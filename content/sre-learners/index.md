Beginning in January 2022 the Op1st community is releasing early (and often) a growing set of course materials for learning SRE methods and practices.
These courses will be tied into the running community cloud, providing a look behind the veil of operations.

Our plans for these courses is extensive and will be laid out on these pages.
In the meantime, DIY learners are encouraged to begin [looking around at how project operations are run](community-handbook/operations-intro.md), as a view into how the training courses are going to look.

## Additional Resources
